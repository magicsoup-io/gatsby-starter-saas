# gatsby-starter-saas

The GatsbyJS Starter Saas to build your next Saas product on gatsby! See [demo](https://gatsby-saas.magicsoup.io)

## Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    gatsby new my-saas-product https://github.com/magicsoup-io/gatsby-starter-saas
    cd my-saas-product && yarn && npm start
    ```

## What's special about our magicsoup.io starter?

1.  **`instant-soup`**: This starter is works perfect for Saas products and has the [magicsoup.io/stock](https://github.com/magicsoup-io/magicsoup-stock) module included!

2.  **`hot-and-spicy`**: This starter will always use the most recent version of [magicsoup.io/stock](https://github.com/magicsoup-io/magicsoup-stock).

3. **`ready-to-serve`**: Saas with (dummy-)login, private routes, ready to create the next million dollar idea.

## What's included?


We at [zauberware](https://www.zauberware.com/) love to create code fast and easy for   have included [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system) in our [magicsoup.io/stock](https://github.com/magicsoup-io/magicsoup-stock).

This starter is combining those benefits with GatsbyJS' automatic slug and page creation via [gatsby-transform-remark](https://www.styled-components.com/) and page or SEO globals via [gatsby-transform-json](https://www.styled-components.com/). 

This starter combines the two best things in the world: Writing your content with markdown and render it with `styled-components`. The great `marksy` library enables you to set components for compiled markdown pages.

This starter uses `gatsby-plugin-web-font-loader` to load whatever font is needed for your page. Look at the gatsby-config.js to see configuration options.

This starter includes everything you need to start testing with `jest`. Just run `npm test` to see results for already implements specs.
