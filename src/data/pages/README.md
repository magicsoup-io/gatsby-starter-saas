# gatsby-starter-magicsoup

The GatsbyJS Starter with our react component library soup. - Just add some water!

## Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    gatsby new my-magicsoup-starter https://github.com/magicsoup-io/gatsby-starter-magicsoup
    npm install 
    ## Or use yarn as a package manager if you prefer. 
    ```

## What's special about our magicsoup.io starter?

1.  **`instant-soup`**: This starter is based on the GatsbyJS default starter, but has our [magicsoup.io/stock](https://github.com/magicsoup-io/magicsoup-stock) module included! So you can use it in your templates and components.

2.  **`no-more-noodels`**: Say good-bye to spaghetti code! Keep

3.  **`hot-and-spicy`**: This starter will always use the most recent version of [magicsoup.io/stock](https://github.com/magicsoup-io/magicsoup-stock).

4. **`ready-to-serve`**: Zero config, ready to serve in production. Choose your favorite gatsby deployment.

## What's included?

We at [zauberware](https://www.zauberware.com/) love to create code fast and easy for   have included [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system) in our [magicsoup.io/stock](https://github.com/magicsoup-io/magicsoup-stock).

This starter is combining those benefits with GatsbyJS' automatic slug and page creation via [gatsby-transform-remark](https://www.styled-components.com/) and page or SEO globals via [gatsby-transform-json](https://www.styled-components.com/). 

This starter combines the two best things in the world: Writing your content with markdown and render it with `styled-components`. The great `marksy` library enables you to set components for compiled markdown pages.

This starter uses `gatsby-plugin-web-font-loader` to load whatever font is needed for your page. Look at the gatsby-config.js to see configuration options.

This starter includes everything you need to start testing with `jest`. Just run `npm test` to see results for already implements specs.
